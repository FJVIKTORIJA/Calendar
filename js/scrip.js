/*
Any time an html form submits, the default behavior is that it makes a post request and reloads the page. So to prevent the page from reloading, we need that line you have that says event.preventDefault(); because it stops the page from reloading.

But if the function is not connected to the form, then the code inside the function will not run when the form submits

And the default reload will not be prevented

So make sure to add some code to your javascript file that selects all the forms from the DOM and then add your function as an event listener to the forms

//use
https://api.jquery.com/submit/

You can also use jQueryâ€™s .on method, which can be used to assign any kind of event listener. You just have to specify that you want a submit event listener by passing it a string as the first argument https://api.jquery.com/on/
